        <h2>Prague phenomenon</h2>
        <p>According to Franz Kafka, he who retains the ability to recognize beauty will never grow old.</p>
        <p>Prague, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, held a special place in Kafka’s heart.</p>
        <p>Like him, you’ll be impressed by its rich history and the unconventional way of life of the city’s “bohemian”
            residents.</p>
        <p>Prague is the thousand-year-old centre of Bohemia, and the term "bohemians" has been used over the centuries
            to describe people with a creative and unconventional way of life.</p>
        <p>Prague extends an invitation to everyone who appreciates its genius loci and the unique way of life of the
            Prague people to explore its streets and corners.</p>
        <p>Welcome to all of you who want to be part of the energy of our city, even if just for a short time.</p>
